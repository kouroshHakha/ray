        a MASampleBatch object.

        called it won't get impliciltly called here. We can either provide a callback 
        for env/architecture specific postprocessings or if it is an algorithm specific 
        postprocessings (e.g. ppo needs compute_gae) we will be explicit about it

        corresponding RLTrainer update method. ppo also updates kl divergence on every 
        iteration. 
        
        Note: We can control some event-based updates by setting specific kwargs flags 
        to true. These flags will be broadcasted to each individual trainers update() 
        method. It can also be a dictionary like update_kl = {'policy_1': True, 
        'policy_2': False} to provide different update rules for different policies.
