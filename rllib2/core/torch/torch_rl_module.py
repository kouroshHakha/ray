    #TODO: I don't know if we'd need explore=True / False to change the behavior of sampling
    another alternative is to use explore and only have one sampling method action = out.sample()
    
    # computing (e.g. actor/critic) loss during policy update
    # The output in this use-case will be consumed by the loss function which is 
    # defined by the user (the author of the algorithm).
    # So the structure should flexible to accommodate the various user needs. 
    out = self.model(batch, explore=False, inference=False)
    
    # Note: user knows xyz should exist when forward_train() gets called
