* Amoog has a lot of experience with inference and batch processing That being said, I still prepared that demo, which I would like to showcase, so let me share my screen And just quickly while you set that up, Anthony, Noah, should we expect Jun to join as well, or would just be you? No, he's, he's outside today Okay, so we took the liberty of setting up a workspace in your account using the support access feature, and that way you can play around with the code, you can run it yourself
* So what we wanted to do is just like create like a simple script that would be representative of your workload of what we talked about during our last meeting How did you remember all the parameters I had? We had a recording Yeah, but I feel like this is going to be like pretty representative So I use that example video you have sent, the data
* So I have created a bucket with a thousand of those videos for this demo, running 16 of those So one thing to highlight here is that we are using the new Ray dataset streaming executor, which will be available in Ray 2 I am running a nightly version of Ray here, which has access to that And the streaming executor allows us to very efficiently do this workload without having to load all the data into memory at the same time, which allows us to avoid issues with running out of memory or spilling to disk
* What's sort of the recommended way to update this data set? I think you just update the S3 bucket So one way that I've seen customers do this is using a Lambda function on the AWS side So when a new video shows up in the S3 bucket, you trigger the Lambda function, the Lambda function This all gets kicked off by a customer API request through our platform
* We don't actually run inference immediately when the video comes to the system because inference that we charge for inference Some people just want to store their videos on our system and not have us do work on them So it's actually a separate kickoff I can just tie it to the customer endpoint to have a kickoff
* And I'll hand it over to Brent or Anthony, if you have any other questions, but I'm curious from, from my perspective, Noah, just curious what, what other items or what else you have left to kind of test out just or for us to kind of formulate like some milestones on our side as well I'm going to see if I can get, you know, the, our actual production inference process running and if possible, just let it go for a couple of days and, and monitor it pretty much to production and, and, and make sure everything goes smoothly And during those two days, like what, what is it that you're essentially looking to say like, Hey, this one smoothly versus like when it goes smoothly? Well, certainly, you know, jobs completing but also you know, I'll tag all the EC2 machines, get the, the cost you know, divided by the non-videos and compare it to the, our calculations from before Just out of curiosity, what were you running the AWS batch? Cause, cause I think you said that it was only running on one instance at a time, correct? Like, like, yeah, one, one, one, one P3, P3 2x large, which is a V100 GPU, which is, which would be overkill for this inference job, except it's a long story, but basically the old, the old version of the Formable Jeter, not the Hugging Face one, but the original one had a custom compiled operator that only worked on certain GPUs
* Of course, when you started, like everything is still going to be there, so you can just play around with it So if I have a simple task like this, and this guy's job is just to either load a file into object memory from the local cache If it doesn't exist there, it gets it from S3 And if it's not in the local cache, it gets the object and then calls to save the local cache task to save it to the local cache
* And then with any scale SDK, you can trigger any scale job Or you could have a job, you know, if you know any files in this bucket that showed up over the last 24 hours If you have it set up on a schedule, you can do it that way as well That should be in your scale console
* Does that make sense, Noah? Yeah, it does The other question I had is how do I get Ray to stop complaining about relaunching thousands of tasks? Like, it's not a problem It just gives me error messages Do you have an example of a error message? Let me see if I can find one
* So what we do here is we create a dataset pipeline by defining a load clip method So what's going to happen is that we read the binary files So those are our videos from S3 We then define the load clip


Q: How to choose what business to start?

A: First off don't be in a rush. Look around you, see what problems you or other people are facing, and solve one of these problems if you see some overlap with your passions or skills. Or, even if you don't see an overlap, imagine how you would solve that problem anyway. Start super, super small.


Q: Should we start the business on the side first or should we put full effort right from the start?

A:   Always on the side. Things start small and get bigger from there, and I don't know if I would ever “fully” commit to something unless I had some semblance of customer traction. Like with this product I'm working on now!


Q: Should we sell first than build or the other way around?

A: I would recommend building first. Building will teach you a lot, and too many people use “sales” as an excuse to never learn essential skills like building. You can't sell a house you can't build!


Q: Andrew Chen has a book on this so maybe touché, but how should founders think about the cold start problem? Businesses are hard to start, and even harder to sustain but the latter is somewhat defined and structured, whereas the former is the vast unknown. Not sure if it's worthy, but this is something I have personally struggled with

A: Hey, this is about my book, not his! I would solve the problem from a single player perspective first. For example, Gumroad is useful to a creator looking to sell something even if no one is currently using the platform. Usage helps, but it's not necessary.


Q: What is one business that you think is ripe for a minimalist Entrepreneur innovation that isn't currently being pursued by your community?

A: I would move to a place outside of a big city and watch how broken, slow, and non-automated most things are. And of course the big categories like housing, transportation, toys, healthcare, supply chain, food, and more, are constantly being upturned. Go to an industry conference and it's all they talk about! Any industry…


Q: How can you tell if your pricing is right? If you are leaving money on the table

A: I would work backwards from the kind of success you want, how many customers you think you can reasonably get to within a few years, and then reverse engineer how much it should be priced to make that work.


Q: Why is the name of your book 'the minimalist entrepreneur' 

A: I think more people should start businesses, and was hoping that making it feel more “minimal” would make it feel more achievable and lead more people to starting-the hardest step.


Q: How long it takes to write TME

A: About 500 hours over the course of a year or two, including book proposal and outline.


Q: What is the best way to distribute surveys to test my product idea

A: I use Google Forms and my email list / Twitter account. Works great and is 100% free.


Q: How do you know, when to quit

A: When I'm bored, no longer learning, not earning enough, getting physically unhealthy, etc… loads of reasons. I think the default should be to “quit” and work on something new. Few things are worth holding your attention for a long period of time.


Q: What is the use-case?

A:
