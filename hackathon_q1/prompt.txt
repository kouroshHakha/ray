Context that may be useful, pulled from The Minimalist Entrepreneur:

* So if you have like a large amount of videos, this is what you are going to see all the time, like almost maximum GPU saturation Well, this is really impressive, and I don't know what to say I've never had a software vendor do this kind of work
* Feel free to reach out with any questions
* And this happens frequently with this sort of thing And so, maybe this wasn't the right example No, I don't have one here
* So what we wanted to do is just like create like a simple script that would be representative of your workload of what we talked about during our last meeting How did you remember all the parameters I had? We had a recording Yeah, but I feel like this is going to be like pretty representative
* And I was able to get around 90, 95% GPU utilization once the first batch is starting to be processed How did you retrieve? Oh, right, you didn't have to I was going to ask how you retrieved the model weights, but then I realized you loaded it from a pre-trained
* Well, I, I again, super appreciate this inference code you created and I'm going to try it out immediately and thanks for answering my questions And I'll hand it over to Brent or Anthony, if you have any other questions, but I'm curious from, from my perspective, Noah, just curious what, what other items or what else you have left to kind of test out just or for us to kind of formulate like some milestones on our side as well I'm going to see if I can get, you know, the, our actual production inference process running and if possible, just let it go for a couple of days and, and monitor it pretty much to production and, and, and make sure everything goes smoothly
* Just in that one function, it sort of just had that duplicate I don't think it's that big a deal I was just curious if there's a better way to handle it
* It's just every 24 hours, every once a week, however often you want to do it That's just another way to have that capability This is, again, very, very neat
* Of course, when you started, like everything is still going to be there, so you can just play around with it So if I have a simple task like this, and this guy's job is just to either load a file into object memory from the local cache If it doesn't exist there, it gets it from S3
* But then when I return it, I feel like it's going to build a second reference to the same thing to return to the color And so, I wasn't sure how to navigate that situation I mean, these objects could potentially be 100 megabytes


Q: How to choose what business to start?

A: First off don't be in a rush. Look around you, see what problems you or other people are facing, and solve one of these problems if you see some overlap with your passions or skills. Or, even if you don't see an overlap, imagine how you would solve that problem anyway. Start super, super small.


Q: Should we start the business on the side first or should we put full effort right from the start?

A:   Always on the side. Things start small and get bigger from there, and I don't know if I would ever “fully” commit to something unless I had some semblance of customer traction. Like with this product I'm working on now!


Q: Should we sell first than build or the other way around?

A: I would recommend building first. Building will teach you a lot, and too many people use “sales” as an excuse to never learn essential skills like building. You can't sell a house you can't build!


Q: Andrew Chen has a book on this so maybe touché, but how should founders think about the cold start problem? Businesses are hard to start, and even harder to sustain but the latter is somewhat defined and structured, whereas the former is the vast unknown. Not sure if it's worthy, but this is something I have personally struggled with

A: Hey, this is about my book, not his! I would solve the problem from a single player perspective first. For example, Gumroad is useful to a creator looking to sell something even if no one is currently using the platform. Usage helps, but it's not necessary.


Q: What is one business that you think is ripe for a minimalist Entrepreneur innovation that isn't currently being pursued by your community?

A: I would move to a place outside of a big city and watch how broken, slow, and non-automated most things are. And of course the big categories like housing, transportation, toys, healthcare, supply chain, food, and more, are constantly being upturned. Go to an industry conference and it's all they talk about! Any industry…


Q: How can you tell if your pricing is right? If you are leaving money on the table

A: I would work backwards from the kind of success you want, how many customers you think you can reasonably get to within a few years, and then reverse engineer how much it should be priced to make that work.


Q: Why is the name of your book 'the minimalist entrepreneur' 

A: I think more people should start businesses, and was hoping that making it feel more “minimal” would make it feel more achievable and lead more people to starting-the hardest step.


Q: How long it takes to write TME

A: About 500 hours over the course of a year or two, including book proposal and outline.


Q: What is the best way to distribute surveys to test my product idea

A: I use Google Forms and my email list / Twitter account. Works great and is 100% free.


Q: How do you know, when to quit

A: When I'm bored, no longer learning, not earning enough, getting physically unhealthy, etc… loads of reasons. I think the default should be to “quit” and work on something new. Few things are worth holding your attention for a long period of time.


Q: Why was the user impressed?
