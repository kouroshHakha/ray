We can leave this demo first demo first and we can kind of jump in as we have questions, but and then we can get to the RL specific stuff after that',\n",

       " 'So at the top most here we have, so the way to think about it is like AnyScale, we want to accelerate our journey from development to production',\n",
       " 'So for, to accelerate development, we have this concept of workspaces, which is essentially like a development environment that runs on the cloud',\n",
       " \"So the idea is like, typically you guys must be very familiar with this, right? Like when you're developing ML applications, you focus on the application, you try to make it work on one machine\",\n",
       " \"And then when you want to scale it out to several machines, that's when sort of, there's like a big lift required to translate that application code and make it more distributed\",\n",

       " \"So I'll dive deeper into this in a bit, but you know, like workspaces is one way\",\n",
       " 'The other way you can develop with Ray is using interactive sessions',\n",
       " 'So here, you know, using our AnyScale product, you can spin up, you know, one or many clusters and then using your favorite IDE, you can like launch jobs against those clusters',\n",

       " 'Yeah, they are',\n",
       " 'So these are actually EC2 instances running in your cloud account',\n",
       " 'Yeah',\n",
       " 'Okay',\n",
       " \"And then sorry, for the workspaces, you showed us a terminal, but it looks like there's a Jupyter logo up above\",\n",
       " 'Could you, could you do a notebook if you wanted? Yeah, absolutely',\n",
       " \"So let's just jump into this then\",\n",
       " 'So so yeah, I mean, basically, you can launch a Jupyter session or a VS code session, right? So we support both those',\n",
       " 'So in this case, you can launch a new terminal and then or sorry, a Jupyter session and then anything you do here is going to actually run on this remote cluster',\n",
       " 'Okay',\n",
       " 'Cool',\n",
       " 'Okay',\n",
       " 'And then you can Yeah',\n",
       " \"And so so that's one way to interact with the workspace\",\n",
       " 'The other way is you can actually launch, you know, visual session on your local Visual Studio code',\n",
       " \"So if you're used to developing using the desktop client, so like, for example, I can create a new file here, let me call it like test\",\n",
       " 'py',\n",
       " 'You know, and then I write a short script, like, right, and then I run this',\n",

       " \"py, right? So it's like, as you're developing locally, like it's actually syncing your, you know, your files to the remote cluster\",\n",
       " 'And so, you know, you can actually develop like a developing on the cloud, cool',\n",
       " \"And then, you know, like, while you know, when you're creating a workspace, there are a lot of things, you know, ways you can configure that workspace\",\n",
       " 'So at a high level, the three different ways are, you can define something what we call is a cluster environment',\n",
       " 'So these are basically a set of dependencies that will be installed on every node in your cluster, right? So we, you know, out of the box, we have several cluster environments that are suited for, you know, machine learning applications, or, you know, not, you know, regular like application, different Python versions, things like that',\n",
       " \"Or if you know, there's something which doesn't meet your requirements, you can actually navigate to the configurations tab, and then just, you know, create your own cluster environment\",\n",
       " 'So either you can install, you know, various packages, Conda packages, define environment variables, and additionally, you know, you can also enter, you know, ad hoc postal command to set up that environment for your application',\n",
       " 'Lastly, if you already have a CI CD pipeline in place, you know, you can, what you can do is just like point, you know, provide, enter like a URL for an artifact repository and like just pull that image on and prove it and, and any scale will provision it to, you know, every node on the cluster',\n",

       " 'You might know them, maybe not, but they would build a model and then have to get that in production',\n",

       " 'Yeah',\n",
       " \"Something that I think was not, I don't know if it's going to be mentioned on the product is like the auto scaling capability where you start developing on a small instance machine, like let's say M5, right? That had 32 CPU's, something like that\",\n",
       " \"You develop your thing and then when you want to scale it up, you just like change a parameter number of workers, let's say a thousand\",\n",

       " \"But it's definitely it's something that we're we're keeping in mind, like as we as we eventually decide on on what to what path forward we take, we that's one of the things that we're going to need\",\n",
       " 'Yeah, we actually just released a partnership with weights and biases first party',\n",
       " \"There's actually a webinar that just came out, I think last week, but I think that's what you're showing today\",\n",
       " \"Yeah, yeah, that's what I was pointing to, like, you know, in the documentation, there's like a really good example of how you could, you know, integrate rates and biases\",\n",
       " 'So in this case, for example, like, you know, in the training function, you can define callbacks, which basically, you know, pipe out like these, you know, the training metrics to like weights and biases, and then they sort of, you know, visualize and, you know, you can sort of use like their UI to sort of, you know, monitor your experiment',\n",

       " \"So you know, so like, let's say, you know, use work faces, you're, you know, iterating, you get your workload out on like, you know, large clusters, and now you want to, you know, productionize this, we offer like a couple of ways to do that\",\n",
       " 'The first is what we call a production job',\n",
       " 'So you know, you can think of this like a cron job, which can be scheduled to run, you know, once, you know, like, depending upon a particular schedule',\n",
       " 'And what endscaling will do is it will manage the orchestration of spinning up a cluster, you know, running your Python script on it, scaling it out',\n",
       " 'And then once the job is complete, like, you know, carrying the cluster down',\n",
       " 'So this is used by a lot of our customers, you know, for periodic jobs, or, you know, certain experiments that they want to be, you know, running once every certain period of time',\n",
       " 'So for example, like, in supply chain, like, you know, you would want to, since your SKUs are, you know, they come in, like, at a, like, you know, very, you know, slow speed, right',\n",
       " 'So we have customers that are retraining their, you know, algorithm, like on a schedule, like at the beginning of every month',\n",
       " 'And they, so they run these jobs, you know, and it gives them several different, you know, models and then they, you know, check performance and then deploy it in their production workflows',\n",
       " \"Do you guys see that as a punchy use case for you guys, or is that something more, or if at all? So you're talking sort of retraining, or we certainly have the idea of, like, maybe a scheduled or sort of batch use case\",\n",
       " \"Is it fair to say, you don't have that today, but potentially on the line, something you'd like to, okay, cool\",\n",
       " 'Yeah, cool',\n",
       " \"So yeah, I mean, so that, you know, as you can probably, like, extrapolate it, it's very self-contained, right\",\n",
       " \"So easily, if you're, especially for cost tracking, you can, you know, it's good to get a sense of, like, how much my training job is costing and, you know, like, any scale help to do that quickly\",\n",
       " 'The second way to sort of productionize your app is using any scale services',\n",
       " 'So here you can, you know, stand up an endpoint, which is, like, you know, always on and available for, you know, your users to make requests',\n",
       " 'So again, what any scale will do is, like, it can, you know, scale out these deployments based on the number of requests that come in',\n",
       " 'And then, you know, we have, like, different components set up that ensure, you know, the high scalability, reliability, and performance',\n",
       " \"I'll maybe quickly touch upon how you can set up a production service since you asked about it\",\n",
       " 'So essentially, so there, so at the application level, there are a few things you would have to do, and all of this, again, is, like, you know, available in our documentation, but let me just quickly touch that',\n",
       " \"And Alex, while you're doing that, you have, I think you mentioned the number seven, but I think that's the goal of maybe this year\",\n",
       " \"I guess how many models do you have in production today, or is that something you're trying to get to? Today, I think there's one, and we expect that to grow a lot\",\n",
       " 'The exact number is hard to say',\n",
       " \"Maybe the verb that you used was, if we got the seven or eight, we'd have a scaling problem\",\n",
       " 'Yeah, maybe something like that',\n",
       " 'Okay, okay',\n",
       " \"And that one you're using today, is that via SageMaker, or is that? Yeah, it's your SageMaker\",\n",
       " \"So yeah, here's a very simple example of how you can, you know, convert your application code into a race of deployment, and it's literally like just adding a decorator to the class\",\n",
       " 'If you want to, you know, set up like different routes, you know, on functions, you know, you can do that',\n",
       " 'And all of this is detailed in the documentation',\n",
       " 'And this would be like the first step, basically, you would have to, you know, make a few changes to your application code',\n",
       " \"And then next, it would be to define like a YAML file in services, here, you'll define your entry point, you know, which has a Python, you know, your application, you'll have to define a cluster environment and a compute config\",\n",

       " \"And in any scale, we'll like manage the rest\",\n",

       " 'So you know, when you want to change, like upgrade, you know, the version of your application code, you know, we support that as well',\n",
       " \"And like, the way to do it is literally just upgrade your YAML file and then, you know, redeploy your service and then, you know, any stable ensure that, you know, all user requests are sort of serviced while it's making that change\",\n",

       " 'Should I go over the questions first one by one and then deeper if you need to? I think I think maybe a quick like overview verbally, maybe just like why RLib was built and the value of overstable baseline and other tools and maybe answer those questions',\n",
       " 'So RLib was this library that basically was built on top of Ray to serve, you know, RL components',\n",
       " \"And something that is interesting about RL is like in the early days, I think it's still true is like the scaling of environment sampling was a problem\",\n",

    "    qa_examples = [\n",
    "        \"\\n\\n\\nQ: How to choose what business to start?\\n\\nA: First off don't be in a rush. Look around you, see what problems you or other people are facing, and solve one of these problems if you see some overlap with your passions or skills. Or, even if you don't see an overlap, imagine how you would solve that problem anyway. Start super, super small.\",\n",
    "\n",
    "        \"\\n\\n\\nQ: Should we start the business on the side first or should we put full effort right from the start?\\n\\nA:   Always on the side. Things start small and get bigger from there, and I don't know if I would ever “fully” commit to something unless I had some semblance of customer traction. Like with this product I'm working on now!\",\n",
    "\n",
    "        \"\\n\\n\\nQ: Should we sell first than build or the other way around?\\n\\nA: I would recommend building first. Building will teach you a lot, and too many people use “sales” as an excuse to never learn essential skills like building. You can't sell a house you can't build!\",\n",
    "\n",
    "        \"\\n\\n\\nQ: Andrew Chen has a book on this so maybe touché, but how should founders think about the cold start problem? Businesses are hard to start, and even harder to sustain but the latter is somewhat defined and structured, whereas the former is the vast unknown. Not sure if it's worthy, but this is something I have personally struggled with\\n\\nA: Hey, this is about my book, not his! I would solve the problem from a single player perspective first. For example, Gumroad is useful to a creator looking to sell something even if no one is currently using the platform. Usage helps, but it's not necessary.\",\n",
    "\n",
    "        \"\\n\\n\\nQ: What is one business that you think is ripe for a minimalist Entrepreneur innovation that isn't currently being pursued by your community?\\n\\nA: I would move to a place outside of a big city and watch how broken, slow, and non-automated most things are. And of course the big categories like housing, transportation, toys, healthcare, supply chain, food, and more, are constantly being upturned. Go to an industry conference and it's all they talk about! Any industry…\",\n",
    "\n",
    "        \"\\n\\n\\nQ: How can you tell if your pricing is right? If you are leaving money on the table\\n\\nA: I would work backwards from the kind of success you want, how many customers you think you can reasonably get to within a few years, and then reverse engineer how much it should be priced to make that work.\",\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        \"\\n\\n\\nQ: Why is the name of your book 'the minimalist entrepreneur' \\n\\nA: I think more people should start businesses, and was hoping that making it feel more “minimal” would make it feel more achievable and lead more people to starting-the hardest step.\",\n",
    "\n",
    "        \"\\n\\n\\nQ: How long it takes to write TME\\n\\nA: About 500 hours over the course of a year or two, including book proposal and outline.\",\n",
